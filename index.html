   <p>The conflict in Syria began in 2011 during the popular uprising now known as the Arab Spring. During
   this revolutionary period many Islamic Countries, including Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, erupted in protests against thier
   tyranical rulers. Several of these protests successfully ousted their leaders with little or no bloodshed. However, others,
   like Syria erupted into a full blown and devastating civil war</p>

   <p>In Syria the protests began as a way to oust the brutal regime led by Bashar al-Assad. Protests, like in many other contries,
   began peacefully. However as the protesters gained momentum the regime responded with violence. The population of Sryia felt
   as though they had no choice, but to fight back. </p>
